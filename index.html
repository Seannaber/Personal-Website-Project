        <h2>WHO AM I?</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a print designer by trade with over ten years of experience in the field. My concentration has been retail design, including, but not limited to, signage, preprint, newspaper, large format advertising, web graphics and e-mail.

        <h2>WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?</h2>
        <p>
          In an effort to learn web development from the ground up, this entire site will be hand-coded. Not a single part of it has been copied from any source. When I'm done, I'll have a basic understanding of HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and jQuery.

      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h2>OTHER INTERESTS</h2>
        <p>
          My interests outside of design and coding include listening to music, cooking and way too much fantasy football.
